{"name":"Love-live-group-rank-screen","tagline":"This mini project implements a front-end version of a web page that appeared in an anime show.","body":"# Front End Implementation from Screenshots\r\n\r\n## What is this?\r\nI made the web page that the girls from the Love Live anime are looking when they want to find out their group’s ranking. I also made this same page responsive, to look like the phone app that Honoka is looking at in Season 1 Episode 11.\r\n\r\n## Why?\r\nI wanted to practice implementing ‘comps’. Since I don’t have real comps, I took screenshots of a web page that appeared in an anime show that I enjoy ([Love Live: School Idol Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_Live!)). \r\n\r\n## How did you get the specs if you didn’t have real comps?\r\nI guessed the site could be made at 960 pixel wide, so I resized the screenshot to show the website at 960 pixels. Using that resized image, I measured everything else on the page with a pixel ruler. I viewed the screenshots in Firefox and used a color picker add on tool to capture the color codes. I could not find exact matching fonts, graphics or icons, so I found ones that fit the ‘spirit’ of the originals. \r\n\r\nThe mobile version has a viewing area suitable for an app but not a website (it’s not clear if the site is an app or a webpage); I took more liberties implementing the mobile site than the desktop site. \r\n\r\n## What technology skills were learned/retrieved?\r\nSASS, CSS3,  Responsiveness decisions, HTML5 Boilerplate, Brackets Editor, GIMP\r\n\r\n## What are this project’s limitations?\r\nNon-functional (it’s meant to practice front-end)\r\nFonts are not exact\r\nNo stretchiness in mobile\r\n\r\n## References\r\n* Love Live Episodes 9, 10\r\n* [Free Ruler Mac tool](http://www.pascal.com/software/freeruler/)\r\n* [colorPicker Firefox add-on](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/colorpicker/?src=api)\r\n* [Brackets](http://brackets.io/)\r\n* [gimp.org](gimp.org)\r\n\r\n### Fonts and font icons:\r\n[Raleway Font](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Raleway)\r\n\r\n[Fontenello](http://fontello.com/) - this website was used to get the font icons used in the lower right\r\n\r\nFont license info\r\n* Modern Pictograms\r\n   Copyright (c) 2012 by John Caserta.
